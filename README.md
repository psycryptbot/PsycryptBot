# PsycriptBot

*A potential leader in crypto bots, it is the #1 go-to for autonomous trading.*

This is what we want to say in the future. For now, there is a lot of work ahead...

## Step 1
We have to cover our bases. Here are some questions that should be adequately covered in this sheet. Everything in this sheet is up to interpretation until it is a reality. 

- What are we going to accomplish?
- What technologies will we need to use to accomplish this? 
- Can this be done in a reasonable amount of time? 

### What are we going to accomplish?
The goal of this bot is to ... 

*(establish dominance in every way; In the crypto market, in global exchanges, and in strategy development. We will put all day traders to shame)* 

... create a basis for a very reliable passive income within as many markets as possible. There is a common term in the world of cryptocurrency: "Going to the moon." Taking inspiration from a very prominent figure in moon exploration, we are attempting to go a step further. We aren't just going to land on the moon and fist-bump Dogecoin while we're there. No, "... we are going to steal the moon!"

Using multiple methods, we want to take trading to a far greater level by multiplying our resources with every step. Using what money we have earned from a well-performing "single instance" trial, we will start investing in machines to run more instances of the bot simultaneously. Collectively it will be equivalent to a farm with close to unlimited expansion capabilities.

To say that we have accomplished what we came to do, we need some stepping stones to give ourselves a reality check once and a while. Each stepping stone can be marked as achieved when the preferred outcome is hit for a month straight at least once (or we accomplished better for that amount of time as well). We can keep an internal tally for each achievement and create a graph at the end of each month. An achievement marked with "(O)" can only be achieved once. At the end of the year, we tally up the total results for our range average. We can see where we need to improve from there. We will also begin moving down the time from weeks to days, from days to hours, from hours to minutes; Eventually, down to seconds. The end achievement is $1 a second. By then, we'll have new achievements.

- $1 <= P <= $20 / week
- $20 < P  <= $25 / week 
- $25 < P <= $50 / week
- $50 < P <= $75 / week
- $75 < P <= $100 / week
- $14 <= P < $25 / day 
    - `Major Achievment #1`
- $25 < P <= $35 / day
- $35 < P $45 / day
- $45 < P <= $55 / day
- $55 < P <= $65 / day
- $65  < P <= $75 / day
- $75  < P <= $85 / day
- $85  < P <= $95 / day
- $95 < P <= $100 / day 
    - `Major Achievment #2`
- $4.1 < P <= $10 / hour
- etc...

It's an infinite money glitch, and we're going to take it all the way!

### What technologies will we need to use to accomplish this

To get this done, we'll need to utilize large amounts of physical machines to run as many instances of this as possible. For this repository, we'll use NodeJS with its accompanying packages. This will allow for a faster development speed to get this completed faster.
